Mac OS X launchd plists
=======================

This directory contains property list (plist) files for the Mac OS X launchd
init system.

NOTE: at the moment, there is no universal solution for launching NUT drivers.
The `upsdrvctl` binary does not provide an option to stay in the foreground,
since it simply starts the driver(s), and terminates. One option is to write a
tool that would create a separate launchd job for each UPS listed in
`ups.conf`.
